Job Title: Python Backend Developer Location: [Remote / On-site – City, Country] Job Type: Full-Time About the Role We are looking for a Python Backend Developer who can architect, build, and maintain efficient, reusable, and reliable backend systems. You’ll be working closely with frontend developers, DevOps, and product teams to deliver scalable web applications and APIs. This isn’t just a coding job — we want someone who can think critically, spot flaws before deployment, and build systems that last. Key Responsibilities Design, build, and maintain robust backend services using Python (Django, Flask, or FastAPI). Develop and consume RESTful and/or GraphQL APIs. Implement data models, storage systems, and caching layers using PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, etc. Write unit, integration, and load tests for critical systems. Optimize code for performance, reliability, and scalability. Collaborate with frontend engineers and designers to ship end-to-end features. Own your deployments — CI/CD pipelines, containerization (Docker), and basic cloud setups (AWS, GCP, or Azure). Monitor and debug production issues with observability tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry). Participate in code reviews, architecture planning, and technical design discussions. Must-Have Skills Strong proficiency in Python 3.x. Solid experience with at least one web framework (Flask, Django, FastAPI). Understanding of RESTful design principles and API authentication (OAuth2, JWT, etc.). Experience with relational and NoSQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB). Familiarity with Docker and basic container orchestration. Knowledge of Git, GitHub/GitLab workflows, and agile practices. Ability to write clean, modular, well-documented code. Good-to-Have (Bonus Points) Experience with async programming (e.g., asyncio, aiohttp). Familiarity with event-driven systems (RabbitMQ, Kafka). Worked on large-scale systems or microservices architecture. Knowledge of DevOps practices and IaC tools like Terraform. Contributions to open-source projects or a public GitHub portfolio. What You’ll Get Competitive salary and performance bonuses. Remote flexibility or hybrid working (based on location). A team that respects code quality and doesn’t do hero-worship. Opportunity to work on real-world problems with real-world impact. Who Should Apply If you're someone who: Writes Python code that's meant to survive refactors. Understands the “why” behind every design decision. Is comfortable with both building from scratch and improving legacy codebases. Can call out BS in meetings (professionally) and offer better alternatives... We want you on the team.
